Pushing onto github

git init

initializes the git, doesnt need to happen every time

git remote add origin <gitlink> 

the git link is the link from github, and we are adding the location of the origin

git remote -v

checks if we have access to push or fetch.

git add . 

the . will add all the files, you can add individual files if wanted

git commit -m "First commit" 

this just commits whatever is added with a comment

git push origin master

this pushes the files that were added, to the origin master
